# bspline-interactive-demo-gte
Interactive 2D B-spline using Geometric Tools Engine (version 3.2)

Note: The Visual Studio project and solution were originally created in GeometricTools\GTEngine\Samples\Mathematics\BSplineCurveInteractive, so you will need to either move them to an equivalent location, or update the include and project reference paths to match your GTE installation.
