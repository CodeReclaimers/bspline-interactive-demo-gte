Interactive 2D B-spline using Geometric Tools Engine (version 3.2)

Short video of the demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hx9rWYnwGU

Note: The Visual Studio project and solution were originally created in GeometricTools\GTEngine\Samples\Mathematics\BSplineCurveInteractive, so you will need to either move them to an equivalent location, or update the include and project reference paths to match your GTE installation.
